# Checkpoint Frontend

Checkpoint Frontend is a service provided by [Checkpoint](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/checkpoint?utm_source=Checkpoint+Website&utm_medium=About+Us), a startup project that has participated in various competitions and won numerous awards, as shown in the [Achievement](#achievement) section below.

Designed for relaxation and personalized experiences, Checkpoint Frontend offers customizable visual scenes, ambient sounds, and music, enabling users to create a calming environment that suits their preferences. To access this service, please visit https://checkpoint.tokyo (currently only available on desktops).

To power this service, Checkpoint Frontend relies on APIs provided by [Checkpoint Backend](https://github.com/KritapasSuwannawin/Checkpoint-Backend), a RESTful API server that serves as the backend for the website.

## Tech Stack

This project uses a number of key libraries and cloud services, including:

- **ReactJS**, a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**, a routing library for React that provides a way to navigate between different components of the application.
- **Redux Toolkit**, a set of tools built on top of the Redux state management library that simplifies common Redux use cases.
- **Firebase Authentication**, a user authentication and identity management service.

This project and its associated cloud services are hosted on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, utilizing **AWS Amplify** for this project, **AWS S3** for cloud storage, and **AWS CloudFront** for CDN.

## Roadmap

My plan to improve the current version of this project primarily focuses on enhancing the website's aesthetics. The following are the improvements that I plan to do:

- Add micro-interactions to enhance the hover and active states of each component.
- Implement transitions between each component (possibly using the React Transition Group library).
